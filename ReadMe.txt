Archiact Code Challenge
============================================================

This solution contains a few projects with incomplete functionality, which it is your goal to implement.

* ObjectPool_Question: (Required)
	Question.h outlines the goal of this project, the code for your solution will go in Answer.cpp
	The object pool class has some boiler plate code, but feel free to add whatever functions you want.
	
	This is mainly a design question, so consider edge cases and the programmer's user experience.


* Math_Question: (Bonus!)
	The math question is in Math_Question.cpp
	Once again, the function boiler plate is provided, but feel free to add mroe functions, 
	or modify the existing definition if you wish to add mroe functionality.
	
	This is a bonus question if you feel up to it!
